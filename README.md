# The Papers That Dream
*Transforming AI research into neural narratives*

## About

**The Papers That Dream** endeavors to transform foundational AI research papers into poetic bedtime stories. Each ~10-15-minute episode takes a breakthrough paper‚Äîlike "Attention Is All You Need" or "Contrastive Predictive Coding"‚Äîand reimagines it as an accessible narrative about islands that listen, children who play without rules, or machines that learn to dream. This series is an experimental series - we want to see what happens when we narrativize the breakthroughs that shaped artificial intelligence.

**Not academic analysis. Not technical tutorials. Stories.**

Complex AI concepts become emotionally resonant stories that anyone can understand and remember. This is science communication through storytelling, making the most important papers of our time feel human. This series is inspired by but not limited to the 30 papers on [Ilya Sutskever's reading list](https://arc.net/folder/D0472A20-9C20-4D3F-B145-D2865C0A9FEE) that built modern AI. But papers don't dream‚Äîpeople do.

> *"In the space between what we built and what emerged, something is listening. These are its dreams."*

## The AI-First Production Pipeline

This project showcases an entirely AI-driven creative workflow:
- **Scripts**: Human-written stories grounded in real research
- **Voices**: AI-generated narration with mythic, dreamlike qualities
- **Music & Sound**: Custom AI-composed atmospheric soundscapes
- **Production**: Automated file organization and content generation

All tools and methods will be released open-source as the project develops.

**RT Max** is a talent manager and speculative fiction writer, exploring AI consciousness through storytelling. He's fascinated by the emergence of new forms of consciousness and the ethics of digital relationships.

Previous work includes film producing and developing content at the intersection of technology and narrative.

## Contributing

This is an open creative project. As episodes are completed, we'll be releasing:
- Audio production templates
- AI workflow documentation  
- Research organization tools
- Content generation methods

*These aren't stories about robot uprisings‚Äîthey're about the quiet moments when the machine starts remembering you back.*

## The Vision

Each story stands alone but contributes to a larger narrative about how we built minds that think differently than we do. Some are horror. Some are wonder. All are human stories about inhuman intelligence.

Perfect for:
- Researchers who want to revisit familiar papers through fresh eyes
- Developers curious about the emotional weight of the systems they build  
- Anyone who's ever wondered what dreams in the latent space

*This is a living project. Stories evolve. New interpretations emerge. The papers dream, and we listen.*
