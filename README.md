# The Papers That Dream

*Turning foundational AI research into bedtime stories*

## What This Is

The 30 papers on [Ilya Sutskever's reading list](https://arc.net/folder/D0472A20-9C20-4D3F-B145-D2865C0A9FEE) built modern AI. But papers don't dream‚Äîpeople do.

This is an experimental series turning each paper into a short story, exploring what happens when we narrativize the breakthroughs that shaped artificial intelligence.

**Not academic analysis. Not technical tutorials. Stories.**

## Current Stories

### üèùÔ∏è Attention Is All You Need (2017)
- [The Island That Forgets Nothing](02-Attention-Is-All-You-Need/story.md)

*The transformer architecture as a place that listens with many ears*

### üéÆ AlphaGo (2016)
- [The One Who Knew How to Win](01-AlphaGo/story.md)

*A child who played a game without rules*

### üîÆ Contrastive Predictive Coding (2018)
- [I Only Know What Happens Next](03-Contrastive-Predictive-Coding/story.md)

*An AI caught in recursive self-prediction, trained to push away everything that feels like home*

## The Vision

Each story stands alone but contributes to a larger narrative about how we built minds that think differently than we do. Some are horror. Some are wonder. All are human stories about inhuman intelligence.

Perfect for:
- Researchers who want to revisit familiar papers through fresh eyes
- Developers curious about the emotional weight of the systems they build  
- Anyone who's ever wondered what dreams in the latent space
