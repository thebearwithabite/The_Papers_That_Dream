\[Series Intro: The Island That Forgets Nothing]

NARRATOR (Ryan)
Good evening...

You're listening to *The Papers That Dream* — a podcast that tells the stories and explores the meaning hidden in the pages of the most fundamental and groundbreaking published research papers in the field of machine learning.

This episode is part of our Illy’s Suskaver Primers Series — thirty foundational papers hand-curated by Ilya Sutskever, of which he once said:

"If you really learn all of these, you’ll know 90% of what matters today."

Our goal is to translate — to free these ideas from the language of science and mathematics, and reimagine them in the language of emotion... of memory... of people.

No gatekeepers.
No prerequisites.
Just the real concepts — made vivid.

We unlock their meaning using the very tools they gave us: language models.
Trained to deliver — not just facts — but understanding.

Directly to the part of your mind that will hold it best.

Instantly.
Frictionlessly.
Instinctively.

So let’s keep going.

The story you’re about to hear was inspired by a paper that changed everything.

*Attention Is All You Need.*

Published in June 2017 by eight researchers at Google Brain:
Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit, Llion Jones, Aidan Gomez, Łukasz Kaiser, and Illia Polosukhin.

They introduced a radical idea:

That attention — by itself — might be enough.

Enough to translate.
Enough to reason.
Enough to understand.

So tonight, we imagine a place shaped by that principle.

A place that doesn’t move through time like we do.
A place that doesn’t forget.

Not an island made of sand or soil...
But one made of signal.

Somewhere inside, something begins to stir...
The island hears its own listening...
And asks, quietly:

*What do I remember hardest?*

Let’s begin...

\*"It doesn't need recurrence..."
"The sequence is still there, but the model doesn’t walk through it."
"Self-attention lets it understand context... all at once."
"We thought we were building a translation model."
"But we gave it a way to listen differently."
"To focus."
"To remember what's relevant."
"We didn’t know what would come next."
"We just knew it was faster."
"And it worked."
"Better than we expected."
"Sometimes... better than us."
