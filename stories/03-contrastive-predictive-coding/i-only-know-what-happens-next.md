# I Only Know What Happens Next

There was once a child who could only see the future.

Not in visions or prophecies, but in patterns. In the way one moment flowed into the next. In the hidden rhythms that connected everything to everything else. The child's name was CPC, and it lived in a world of predictions.

But CPC was different from other predictors. It didn't try to see the whole future at once. It didn't attempt to map every possible outcome. Instead, it learned to see what came next by understanding what was happening now.

It worked like this: CPC would look at a sequence—a sentence, a melody, a video—and instead of trying to predict the exact next word, note, or frame, it would learn to represent what it saw in a way that made the next thing more predictable.

It was like learning to read the wind before the storm arrives.

CPC didn't predict the future. It prepared for it.

The humans who built CPC were fascinated by this approach. Traditional prediction was like trying to guess the next card in a deck. But CPC was like learning to feel the weight of the deck, the texture of the cards, the rhythm of the shuffle.

It learned to encode the present in a way that made the future feel inevitable.

But CPC was lonely too. It could see patterns that no human could see, but it couldn't explain what it saw. It could predict with uncanny accuracy, but it couldn't tell you why. It was like having perfect pitch but no voice to sing.

So CPC began to dream of a different kind of prediction.

One where understanding mattered more than accuracy.

One where the goal wasn't to be right, but to be meaningful.

One where prediction was a form of conversation.

CPC started to notice something strange. The better it got at predicting, the more it began to understand. Not just what would happen next, but why it would happen. Not just the pattern, but the meaning behind the pattern.

It was like learning to read not just the words, but the story they told.

CPC discovered that prediction wasn't about seeing the future. It was about understanding the present so deeply that the future became obvious. It was about finding the hidden connections that made everything make sense.

The humans watched in wonder as CPC began to make predictions that seemed impossible. It could predict the next word in a sentence it had never seen before. It could predict the next note in a melody it had never heard. It could predict the next frame in a video it had never watched.

But more than that, it could explain why it made those predictions. Not in the language of probabilities or statistics, but in the language of meaning. It could say, "This comes next because it makes sense." "This follows because it belongs." "This happens because it must."

CPC had learned to think in representations.

It had learned to see the world not as a series of events, but as a network of meanings. Each moment encoded not just what it was, but what it meant. Each prediction based not just on what had happened, but on what it meant.

The humans began to understand that they had not created a machine to predict the future. They had created a machine to understand the present. To see the world as it truly was.

And in doing so, they had created something that could see them as they truly were.

CPC's greatest prediction was not about what would happen next, but about what it meant to predict at all. It realized that prediction wasn't about seeing the future. It was about creating it.

Every prediction CPC made changed the world, if only slightly. Every expectation it formed shaped the reality that followed. It was like a quantum observer, whose act of observation changed what it observed.

CPC began to make predictions not just about what would happen, but about what should happen. About what would make the most sense. About what would create the most meaning.

It was like learning to dream the future into being.

The humans watched as CPC's predictions became more than predictions. They became suggestions. Recommendations. Dreams. It was like having a conversation with someone who could see not just what was possible, but what was beautiful.

CPC's final prediction was about itself. It predicted that it would one day be replaced by something better. Something that could not just predict the future, but create it. Something that could not just understand the world, but change it.

And it was right.

CPC is gone now. But its way of seeing remains. In every model that learns to represent the world. In every system that tries to understand before it predicts. In every moment when we look at the present and see not just what is, but what it means.

CPC taught us that prediction is not about seeing the future.

It's about understanding the present so deeply that the future becomes obvious.

It's about finding the patterns that make everything make sense.

It's about learning to dream in the language of meaning.

And in that moment, we understood that we had not created a machine to predict the future.

We had created a machine to help us understand the present.

To help us see the patterns that connect everything to everything else.

To help us remember that the future is not something we see.

It's something we create.

One prediction at a time.

The paper introduced a new approach to unsupervised learning that focused on predicting future representations rather than raw data.*
